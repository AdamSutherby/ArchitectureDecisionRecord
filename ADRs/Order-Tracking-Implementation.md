## Summary

### Issue

- Determining the architecture and technology stack for implementing real-time order tracking to enhance user experience.

### Decision

- Adopt a WebSocket-based architecture with Node.js and Socket.IO for real-time updates.

### Status

- Accepted

## Details

### Assumptions:

- Users expect timely and accurate updates on the status of their orders.
- Real-time tracking will improve user satisfaction and trust in the app.

### Constraints:

- Compatibility with various mobile and web platforms.
- Scalability to handle concurrent connections and high traffic.

### Positions:

- Prioritize user experience by providing real-time updates on order status.
- Select technology stack based on performance, scalability, and ease of implementation.

### Argument:

- WebSocket technology allows bidirectional communication between the client and server, enabling real-time updates without the need for frequent polling.
- Node.js provides a non-blocking, event-driven architecture suitable for handling concurrent connections and real-time updates.
- Socket.IO is a widely-used library for WebSocket implementation, offering features like fallback mechanisms for compatibility with older browsers.

### Implications:

- Enhanced user experience with real-time updates on order status and progress.
- Increased server load and resource utilization due to maintaining persistent connections.
