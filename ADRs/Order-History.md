## Summary

### Issue

- Deciding on the data storage and retrieval mechanisms to efficiently manage and display users' order history.

### Decision

- Utilize a relational database with optimized queries for storing and retrieving order history data.

### Status

- Accepted

## Details

### Assumptions:

- Users expect quick and easy access to their order history for reordering.
- Efficient data retrieval is essential to provide a seamless user experience.

### Constraints:

- Scalability to handle a potentially large volume of order history data.
- Optimization for fast query execution and response times.

### Positions:

- Prioritize user convenience and accessibility in accessing order history.
- Optimize data storage and retrieval mechanisms for performance and scalability.

### Argument:

- A relational database offers structured data storage and relational queries, enabling efficient organization and retrieval of order history data.
- Indexing and query optimization techniques can enhance query performance, ensuring fast retrieval of relevant order history records.
- Implementing pagination and caching mechanisms further improves data retrieval efficiency and reduces server load.

### Implications:

- Enhanced user experience with fast and convenient access to order history for reordering.
- Increased server load and resource utilization due to frequent order history queries, necessitating optimization measures.
