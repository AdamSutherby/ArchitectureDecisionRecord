## Summary

### Issue

To determine the most suitable development approach (Native, Web, or Hybrid) for the food delivery application.

### Decision

We will develop the food delivery application as a Hybrid mobile application.

### Status

Decided.

## Details

### Assumptions

- Users primarily access the food delivery service through mobile devices.
- Balancing between platform-specific capabilities and cross-platform compatibility is desirable.
- Development resources and expertise are available for web technologies.

### constraints
