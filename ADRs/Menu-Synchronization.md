## Summary

### Issue

- Determining the most efficient and reliable method for synchronizing restaurant menus from inventory management systems into the app.

### Decision

- Utilize APIs for direct integration with restaurants' inventory management systems to ensure accurate and up-to-date menu data.

### Status

- Accepted

## Details

### Assumptions:

- Restaurants' inventory management systems provide APIs or data endpoints for menu access.
- Real-time synchronization is necessary to maintain menu accuracy and availability.

### Constraints:

- Compatibility with diverse inventory management systems used by different restaurants.
- API rate limits and authentication requirements.

### Positions:

- Prioritize real-time data synchronization to provide users with accurate menu information.
- Opt for direct API integration to streamline data retrieval and minimize data discrepancies.

### Argument:

- API integration allows direct access to restaurant menu data, ensuring real-time updates and accuracy.
- APIs provide structured data retrieval and authentication mechanisms, reducing the complexity of data synchronization.
- Direct integration with inventory management systems minimizes reliance on external factors such as website changes or data scraping.

### Implications:

- Improved user experience with up-to-date and accurate restaurant menus.
- Reduced data synchronization overhead and maintenance efforts with direct API integration.
